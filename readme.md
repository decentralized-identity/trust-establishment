# Trust Establishment

## Background
Trust Establishment is a [work item](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/blob/main/work_items/trust_establishment.md) as part of the [Claims & Credentials Working Group](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials).

## Overview

Trust in the decentralized space is a wide problem that many have tried to solve. In this work item we aim to take a piece of the problem around trust establishment. Decentralized trust establishment is the means by which parties answer two key questions about one another:

1. _Are you who you claim to be?_
2. _Are you to be trusted for what you claim to be trusted for?_

Thus far, we've come up with [two specs](./spec) to address these questions. It's likely there are more to come.
