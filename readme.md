# Trust Establishment

## Background
Trust Establishment is a [work item](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/blob/main/work_items/trust_establishment.md) as part of the [Claims & Credentials Working Group](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials).

## Overview

Trust in the decentralized space is a wide problem that many have tried to solve. In this work item we aim to take a piece of the problem around trust establishment. The following items are included in the scope of our work:

- Standardize method for enumerating properties of trust, including expressions of trust beyond binary decisions.
- Standardize method providing foundations of credential issuer and verifier trust.

The above items are served by the following goals:

- Support offline and near-offline evaluations via cacheable assets.
- Avoid leaking information about trust evaluations to parties other than the one performing the evalution.
- Provide informative details for user based and automated trust decisions.
- Produce relevant specifications and reference implementations.
- Guide decisions of interoperability profiles using these specifications.

Thus far, we've come up with [two specs](./spec) to address these questions. It's likely there are more to come.

## Related Work

There are two other similar efforts undergoing active work

### Trust Registry Task Force (ToIP)

We are in active monitoring mode with the ToIP work, with an idea that our work here can serve as the offline ability of their API based approach.

### Verifiable Issuers and Verifiers (CCG)
https://w3c-ccg.github.io/verifiable-issuers-verifiers/

Early conversations at last IIW indicated no active work. That appears to have changed, and we'll be looking to sync up at this next IIW and other methods.

## Prior Art

We're not the first ones in the space to attempt to solve this problem! We've included a [Prior Art](./prior-art) that attempts to note related preceeding efforts.
