# Trust Establishment

## Background
Trust Establishment is a [work item](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/blob/main/work_items/trust_establishment.md) as part of the [Claims & Credentials Working Group](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials).

## Overview

Trust in the decentralized space is a wide problem that many have tried to solve. In this work item we aim to take a piece of the problem around trust establishment. The following items are included in the scope of our work:

- Standardize method for enumerating properties of trust, including expressions of trust beyond binary decisions.
- Standardize method providing foundations of credential issuer and verifier trust.

The above items are served by the following goals:

- Support offline and near-offline evaluations via cacheable assets.
- Avoid leaking information about trust evaluations to parties other than the one performing the evalution.
- Provide informative details for user based and automated trust decisions.
- Produce relevant specifications and reference implementations.
- Guide decisions of interoperability profiles using these specifications.

Thus far, we've come up with [two specs](./spec) to address these questions. It's likely there are more to come.

## Prior Art

We're not the first ones in the space to attempt to solve this problem! We've included a [Prior Art](./prior-art) that attempts to note related preceeding efforts.
