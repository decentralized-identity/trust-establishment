Trust Registry Specification
- April 14, 2022: https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf/blob/main/docs/ToIP%20Trust%20Registry%20V1%20Specification.md

Trust Over IP has specifically stated that the Trust Registry system is meant to describe the "Who" of trust and is not meant to specify the "What".

Trust Registries are also API-centric, requiring a "phone home" by default and limiting their application to those who are willing and able to keep a service running.

## Others:
GlobalID, Trinsic, and Verite have mentioned they have trust establishment systems, but they have not publicly disclosed details. GlobalID and Trinsic appear to be attempting to leverage their code as proprietary competitive advantages.
