## Abstract

Trust in the decentralized identity space is a problem that many have tried to solve. This specification aims to take a piece of the problem around [[ref:Trust Establishment]]: a means by which an [[ref:Party]] communicates their assertions for a [[ref:Topic]] about a set of [[ref:Parties]]. [[ref:Trust Establishment]] is intended to be informational, though it can be used to prescribe resulting action. Not all potential usage will be covered in this specification.

This specification describes only the data model of trust documents and is not opinionated on document integrity, format, publication, or discovery. Because of this, the specification alone cannot ensure interoperability and is recommended for use within one or more multi-layered Interoperability Profile(s) which specify those implementation details.


## Status of This Document

Trust Establishment is a _STRAWMAN_ specification under development within the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). It incorporates requirements and learning from related work of many active industry players into a shared specification that meets the collective needs of the community.

This specification is regularly updated to reflect relevant changes, and we encourage active engagement on [GitHub](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trust-establishment/issues) and other mediums (e.g. [DIF Slack](https://difdn.slack.com/archives/C4X50SNUX)).

## Terminology

[[def:Claim, Claims]]
~ An assertion made about a [[ref:Subject]]. Used as an umbrella term for
Credential, Assertion, Attestation, etc.

[[def: Verifiable Credential, VC, VCs]]
~ Refers to the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model) of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.

[[def:Topic, Topics, Trust Topic]]
~ A [[ref:Schema]]-driven document that gives purpose to a trust document. A topic can be anything: from the tangibly measurable (e.g. success rate of a business process) to the intangible (e.g. how one party feels about another).

[[def:Trust Establishment, Trust Establishment Document, Trust Establishment Documents]]
~ The process by which a [[ref:Party]] makes trust statements about a given [[ref:Party]] for a given [[ref:Topic]] using Trust Establishment Documents.

[[def:Identified Parties, Party, Parties]] 
~ Entities that establish their identity by means of a [[def:Decentralized Identifier]]. Parties are commonly referred to as [[ref:Issuers]], [[ref:Holders]], and [[ref:Verifiers]].

[[def:Trust Host, Topic Host, Host]]
~ Entities that are responsible for hosting and communicating [[ref:Trust Establishment Documents]].

[[def:Issuer, Issuers]]
~ Issuers are entities that issue [[ref:Claims]] to [[ref:Holders]], and may be represented as an [[ref:Identified Party]] inside of a [[ref:Trust Establishment Document]].

[[def:Holder, Holders]]
~ Holders are entities that submit [[ref:Claims]] to [[ref:Verifiers]] which contain [[ref:Parties]] that may be identified in a [[ref:Trust Establishment Document]] to satisfy a [[ref:Presentation]] interaction.

[[def:Verifier, Verifiers]]
~ Verifiers are entities that define what [[ref:Parties]] they accept a
[[ref:Credential]] from in order to proceed with an interaction.

[[def:Presentation, Present]]
~ Presentations are a type of verifiable interaction in which one [[ref:Party]] submits a [[ref:Claim]] or set of [[ref:Claims]] to a [[ref:Verifier]].

[[def:Decentralized Identifier, Decentralized Identifier, DID]]
~ A [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) describing an _identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity_.

[[def:Verifiable Interaction, Verifiable Interactions]]
~ An interaction (e.g. request a claim, present a claim, establish trust) which happens between [[ref:Parties]] using Decentralized Identifiers via [[spec:DID-CORE]].

[[def:Schema, Schemas]]
~ A schema is a vocabulary for a [[ref:Claim]]. Commonly used schema formats include [[ref:JSON Schema]] or [[ref:JSON Linked Data]] as surfaced through [schema.org](https://schema.org/).

[[def:Credential Type, Credential Types]]
~ A [[ref:Verifiable Credential]] always has a [_type_ property](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#types) referencing one or more URIs
which provide information semantic meaning and classification for the data in a credential.

## Structure of this Document
This document has two primary sections: In the first we describe the data models for [[ref:Topics]] and [[ref:Trust Establishment Documents]]. In the second, we cover some usage of [[ref: Trust Establishment Documents]].

Examples in this document use the Verifiable Credentials Data Model [[spec:VC-DATA-MODEL]] and the [[spec:DID-CORE]] formats for illustrative purposes only; this specification is intended to support any JSON-serializable [[ref:Claim]] format and cannot alone ensure interoperability.

## Data Model

[[ref:Trust Establishment Documents]] are objects that articulate information a [[ref:Party]] publishes in order to share _assertions_ about a set of [[ref:DID]]-identified entities. [[ref:Issuers]], [[ref:Verifiers]], and [[ref:Holders]] may find utility in understanding a [[ref:Party]]'s assertions in making decisions in decentralized web interactions.

### Properties

- `id` – The object ****MUST**** contain an `id` property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a string. The string ****SHOULD**** provide a unique ID for the desired context. For example, a [UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) such as `32f54163-7166-48f1-93d8-ff217bdb0653` could provide an ID that is unique in a global context, while a simple string such as `my_trust_establishment-1` could be suitably unique in a local context.
- `author` – The ****MUST**** contain an `id` property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a string value representing the [[ref:DID]] of the author.
- `created` – The object ****MUST**** contain a `created` property proving a date-time value for when the object was created. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) compliant timestamp value.
- `validFrom` - The object ****MUST**** contain a `validFrom` property proving a date-time value for when the object is to be used. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) compliant timestamp value.
- `validUntil` - The object ****MAY**** contain a `validUntil` property proving a date-time value for when the object is no longer to be used. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) compliant timestamp value.
- `version` – The object ****MUST**** contain a `version` property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a number. It is recommended that the value is a monotonic increasing integer value.
- `entries` - The object ****MUST**** contain a `entries` property that represents combinations of `topics` and entities for trust statements. Its value ****MUST**** be a JSON object composed as follows:
    - The object ****MUST**** have map keys as _string_ values identifying the [[ref:Topic]] of the [[ref:Trust Establishment Document]].
    ::: todo
    references a schema uri?
    :::
    - The object ****MUST**** have map values as _JSON objects_, containing _JSON maps_ and ****MUST**** be composed as follows:
      - ****MUST**** have map keys as [[ref:DID]]s which identify [[ref:Parties]] for which trust is being expressed. 
      - ****MUST**** have map values as _JSON objects_ conforming to the associated [[ref:Schema]] of the parent [[ref:Topic]] value.

## Document Integrity

[[ref:Trust Establishment Documents]] may fit into any number of embed targets – verifiable wrappers or embedded proofing formats - to enable data integrity. This specification takes no position on which means are suitable to provide integrity of [[ref:Trust Establishment Documents]] or [[ref:Topics]], however provide a number of examples for convenience.

::: warning Interoperability Notice
Interoperability of trust documents is not possible with this specification alone. It is recommended to use the trust documents within one or more multi-layered Interoperability Profile(s) which specify implementation details.

## Publication & Discovery


While specific recommendations for how to host, publish, and discover Trust Establishment documents is out of scope of this specification we can raise a number of points for consideration for its users.

The publication of the JSON-based documents defined in this specification is a common activity users of the specification will need to engage in for their expressions of trust and sentiment to be discovered and digested by other parties. There are a number of ways to do this, but they should account for the following core abilities:

1. Enable [[ref:Trust Establishment]] documents to be located via crawling a known set of DIDs (via [Service Endpoints](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services)) or some other common routing mechanisms.
2. Enable querying for all or some subset of [[ref: Trust Establishment]] documents from a target entity via common DID-based data query/interaction protocols.

There may be different motivations for interacting with [[ref:Trust Establishment]] documents. Across those motivations there are a common set of questions one may ask themselves before publishing, including:

- Who are the intended consumers of this document, and how might they become aware of it?
- Is this document going to be updated? If so, how are updates shared? How may consumers of older versions become aware that there is a more recent version?
- Is hosting this document with a single party a risk: to availablility, privacy erosion, or censorship in some manner?
- If I intend for this document to be replicated, how do I do that? Is there a way to incentivize other parties to replicate my documents?

### JSON Schema

The [[ref:Trust Establishment]] specification adopts and defines the following [[ref:JSON Schema]] data format and processing variant, which implementers ****MUST**** support for evaluation of the portions of the specification that call for [[ref:JSON Schema]] validation: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html

### Examples

**Example 1 - Sentiment Declaration**

Sentiment Declaration is a usage of the [[ref:Trust Establishment]] data model that provides a means by which an [[ref:Entity]] communicates their sentiment (what they may feel or think) for a [[ref:Topic]] about a set of [[ref:Parties]]. Sentiment Declaration is intended to be informational, and the prescription of any resulting actions taken based on the contents of the document are out of scope of this specification.

As an example, we think of "My Faves". The year is 2007 and your pink-colored mobile carrier announces a program to let you make unlimited calls and texts to five contacts of your choosing: your faves. Using the [[ref:Trust Establishment]] specification, you create a [[ref:JSON Schema]] [[ref:Topic]] that supports you enumerating your faves.

::: example Sentiment of "My Faves" :::

```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-1-schema.json]]
```

:::

Next, you take the "My Faves" schema, and put it in a Trust Establishment document, which you can share with your mobile carrier, or post it on social media if you're feeling bold.

::: example Trust Establishment Sentiment using the "My Faves" Topic

```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-1.json]]
```

:::

You may imagine your carrier similarly using the "My Faves" schema to enumerate favs for all customers, each a separate entity within the [[ref:Trust Establishment Document]].

**Example 2 – Trusted Issuers**

A common usage of [[ref:Trust Establishment Documents]] is by a [[ref:Verifier]] wishing to provide information on which [[ref:Credentials]] they accept from which [[ref:Issuers]]. Using [[ref:Verifiable Credentials]] we know that a given Credential may have a signle schema, but also may reference multiple schemas or `type` documents for the same Credential. Using a "Trusted Issuers for Credential" topic, we can fulfill this use case.

::: example Trusted Issuers for Credential :::

```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-2-schema.json]]
```

:::

Next, you take the "Trusted Issuers For Credential" schema, and put it in a Trust Establishment document, which you can share with any relying party aiming to seek your verification services.

::: example Trust Establishment using the "Trusted Issuers for Credential" Topic

```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-2.json]]
```

:::

**Example 3 - Multiple Topics**

Alice is publishing a list about herself, sharing information that could be used in interactions with her.

::: example
  ```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-3.json]]
```
:::


**Example 4 - Government Flight Regulations**

In this example, the government identified by `did:example:government` is authoring a document showing for which airlines (the given entities) the qualifications needed for each of their pilots: information about a requisite flight school and medical report.

::: example
  ```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-4.json]]
```
:::

**Example 5 - Accepted University Degrees**

In this example, the author is an employer identified by `did:example:employer-1` who is listing which degrees they are willing to accept for applicants from a set of universities.

::: example
  ```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-5.json]]
```
:::

**Example 6 - Pizza Store**

A piza store, identified by `did:example:round-n-proud` is publishing a list of their chosen vendors, including which products they are willing to purchase for each vendor. This is useful for the vendors, and fans of _Round n' Proud_ everywhere that want to try to re-create the pizza at home.

::: example
  ```json
[[insert: ./examples/example-6.json]]
